**Implement a Basic URL Shortener API Endpoint in Node.js with Express and MongoDB.**  
   *Task:*  
   Write two endpoints:
   - A `POST` endpoint (`/shorten`) that takes a long URL and returns a shortened code.
   - A `GET` endpoint (`/:code`) that takes a shortened code, retrieves the original URL from MongoDB, and redirects to it.

Here are two live coding questions with sample solutions for the MERN stack:

### **Create a To-Do List API in Express and MongoDB**

**Task:**
Build a simple API to manage a to-do list with the following endpoints:
- **`POST /todos`**: Add a new to-do item (with a `task` field).
- **`GET /todos`**: Retrieve all to-do items.
- **`DELETE /todos/:id`**: Delete a to-do item by ID.

### **Implement User Registration and Login with JWT in Node.js and MongoDB**

**Task:**
Create a basic authentication system using JWT with the following endpoints:
- **`POST /register`**: Registers a new user with `username` and `password`.
